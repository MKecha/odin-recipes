recipe page for TOP

This project aims to create a mock website using the different techniques I have learned in TOP.  
To make sure I show that I've learned how to use those techniques, I'll have to create an index page that has 4 links, each leading to 3 recipe pages that I will also create. For now the goal is jsut to build something that works. No need to make it looks fancy. 
In accordance with the assignement, each recipe page must have:

- a title
- a header
- a sub header
- a paragraph
- an ordered list
- an unordered list
- an image
