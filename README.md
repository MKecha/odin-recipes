recipe page for TOP

This project aims to create a mock website using the different techniques I have learned in TOP. 
To make sure I show that I've learned how to use those techniques, I will have to make sure this website contains:

- a title
- a header
- a sub header
- a paragraph
- an ordered list
- an unordered list
- an absolute link
- a reltive link
- an image
