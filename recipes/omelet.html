        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an <strong>omelet</strong>. I don't know how to cook and, honestly, I've never made one that looked even remotely as <em>edible</em> as the one in the picture.</p>
        <p>You usually eat it in the morning. You know one of these mornings where, for some reason, you wake and feel like your life isn't a fuck up? Where you think to yourself: "today is the day I take life by the horns"? This <strong>omelet</strong> the perfect way of reminding yourself that you are worthless. If you can't even make an <em>omelet</em> successfully, why would you think that you fix your <em>life</em>? Anyway, here's what's you'll need.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 <strong>eggs</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp. of <strong>butter</strong></li>
            <li>1/3 cup of <strong>diced onions</strong></li>
            <li>1 pinch of <strong>salt</strong></li>
            <li>1 pinch of <strong>black pepper</strong></li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of <strong>fresh coriander</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the <strong>eggs</strong> in a seperate bowl and mix throughly until contents become uniform</li>
            <li>Cut the <strong>coriander</strong> finely (Is that a word? I don't fucking know, man) and add them to the bowl</li>
            <li>Bring pan to medium temperature</li>
            <li>Insert the <strong>butter</strong> and let it melt. Swirl the pan around to make sure the butter covers the entirety of the pan</li>
            <li>Add the mixture</li>
            <li>Let it cook for 5 minutes, then add <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> and fold in half</li>
            <li>Your failed omelet is ready, time to given up and go to bed after having taken a single bite. You weren't hungry anyways.</li>
