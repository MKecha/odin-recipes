recipe page for TOP

This project aims to create a mock website using the different techniques I have learned in TOP. 
To make sure I show that I've learned how to use those techniques, I'll have to create an index page that has 4 links, each leading to 4 recipe pages that I will also create. For now the goal is jsut to build something that works. No need to make it looks fancy. 
In accordance with the assignement, each recipe page must have:

- a title
- a header
- a sub header
- a paragraph
- an ordered list
- an unordered list
- an image
---------------------------------------

Finished coding html for omelet page. It took a bit of time, but I was able to di everything I needed to do without looking anything up. 

I'm pretty happy with how this is coming along. Hopefully as time goes on I'll be able to do whatever I need to do much quick. Maybe even look into that extension that makes adding tags faster. But for now I just wanna focus on learning it the normal way.

tomorrow I hope to finish the project and hopefully start doing some CSS stuff

(some personnal thoughts: I really enjoy the brutalist website style, for some reason, it's also great that it's perfect for a lazy mofo like me!).
