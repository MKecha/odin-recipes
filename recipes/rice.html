        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Your eyes reddened from the constant staring at your computer screen, 
            a jolt of pain in your neck tears you out from your constant state of anhedonia. 
            You tab out of your FFXIV client and look down at the time on your desktop; it is 11pm. 
            You haven't eaten nor drunk in the past 8 hours. As a broke school drop out, 
            you don't even have the luxury to get fat off of fast food. To you, food is an enemy; 
            indeed, it is a last ditch effort for what remains of you humanity to keep going for yet 
            another miserable day.</p>

            <P>You are greeted by a kitchen that mirrors how you feel inside. 
            Yellow, grease stains over the counter left by the previous tennant. 
            No matter how long you stare at the content of your fridge, the only 
            two items contained therein are a bottle of ketchup and some old Kraft Singles, 
            their color turning into a dangerous shade of brown.</P>

            <p>You look up. On top of the fridge is the old rice cooker your mom gave you before you left. 
            The slightest hint of nostalgia rears its dangerous head before you nip it in the bud. 
            Next to the rice cooker, a 2 year old bag of basmati rice. You make a deal with the universe: 
            "If I fail this dish, I am ending it tonight.". After a few minutes of preparation, the following 
            ingredients are on the counter.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A cup of <strong>white basmati rice</strong>;</li>
                <li>Two cups of <strong>water</strong>;</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp. of <strong>Ketchup</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>Excited at the proposect of having the path your life will take dictated by something as 
        trivial as making rice, you plug the rice cooker on a plug above the kitchen counter. 
        You make a game plan.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Do not wash the rice, only people with dignity do so. You have none.</li>
                <li>Insert the cup of <strong>white basmati rice</strong> in the container within the rice cooker.</li>
                <li>Add both cups of <strong>water</strong>, close the rice cooker and set it to white rice</li>
                <li>Wait until ready, then fluff the rice and serve as is. Add Ketchup to your liking</li>
            </ol>
