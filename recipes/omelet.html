        <h2 class="header2">Description</h2>
            <p>This is an <strong>omelet</strong>. I don't know how to cook and, honestly, I've never made one that looked even remotely as <em>edible</em> as the one in the picture.</p>
            <p>You usually eat it in the morning. You know one of these mornings where, for some reason, you wake and feel like your life isn't a fuck up? Where you think to yourself: "today is the day my life gets better"? This <strong>omelet</strong> is the perfect way of reminding yourself that you are worthless. If you can't make an <em>omelet</em> successfully, why would you even think that you can fix your <em>life</em>? Anyway, here's what's you'll need.</p>
        
        <h2 class="header2">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>3 <strong>eggs</strong>;</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp. of <strong>butter</strong>;</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of <strong>diced onions</strong>;</li>
                <li>1 pinch of <strong>salt</strong>;</li>
                <li>1 pinch of <strong>black pepper</strong>;</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of <strong>fresh coriander</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="header2">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="text">
                <li>Crack the <strong>eggs</strong> in a seperate bowl and mix throughly until contents become a uniform mixture;</li>
                <li>Cut the <strong>coriander</strong> finely (Is that a word? I don't know) and add them to the bowl;</li>
                <li>Bring the pan to medium temperature;</li>
                <li>Insert the <strong>butter</strong> and let it melt. Swirl the pan around to make sure the butter covers the entirety of the pan;</li>
                <li>Add the mixture;</li>
                <li>Let it cook for 5 minutes, then add <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> and fold in half;</li>
                <li>Your failed omelet is ready, time to give up and go to bed after having taken a single bite. You weren't hungry anyways.</li>
            </ol>
